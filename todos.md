# THINGS LEFT TO DO

## UI Stuff

- Labels for Operator and LFO panels
- Fix text being clipped on filter panel labels
- Write LookAndFeel code to make the dropdowns from ComboBoxes match the rest of the UI
- Add borders around LFO panels, similar to operator component
- Standardize fonts and sizes on various menus and buttons
